Hello Dear,

Task: Building a Responsive Product Card Component with Redux Integration

Description:
Create a reusable React component that displays product information, integrating Redux for state management. This task involves not only implementing the UI but also thinking about the state structure, actions, and how Redux interacts with your component.

Requirements:

Component Design:

Design a visually appealing product card using CSS (you can use a CSS preprocessor like SASS if you prefer).
Include product name, price, description, and an image in the card.
Ensure the design follows modern UI/UX principles and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
Redux Integration:

Set up a Redux store to manage the product data (name, price, description, image URL).
Create Redux actions and reducers to handle fetching and updating the product data.
Connect your product card component to the Redux store to display and update product information.
Responsiveness:

Make sure the product card adjusts its layout gracefully on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Use CSS media queries to handle responsiveness.
Consider how the content flows and scales to maintain a pleasant user experience.
Props and Reusability:

Create a React component that takes props for product information (name, price, description, image URL).
Make the component easily reusable with customizable product data.

Think about potential edge cases and error handling. How will the component handle missing data or invalid inputs?
Implement loading indicators or error messages when fetching data from Redux.
Optional Enhancements:

Add animations or transitions to make the card more interactive and engaging.
Implement a hover effect to display additional product information or options.
Documentation:

Provide clear and concise documentation on how to use the component, including the expected props and their types.
Document the Redux store structure, actions, and how the component interacts with Redux.
